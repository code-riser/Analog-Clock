# Analog-Clock
This is a working analog clock made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML creates the structure, CSS styles the clock face and hands, and JavaScript updates the hand positions in real-time based on the current time. It demonstrates DOM manipulation and CSS transforms for smooth rotation.
